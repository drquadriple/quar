# quar
A shitty AUR helper with a very small amount of features that was created in 20 minutes for the sole purpose of doing something interesting with my life.

it's in the fucking description;
two shell scripts that can install and remove aur packages that were just made for fun, it IS plenty lighter than paru or yay, so do whatever you want.

be sure to make them executable!

remember! quar is not complete, expect a rewrite to come out in the near feature!
-------------
installation:
-------------
$ `git clone https://github.com/drquadriple/quar`

$ `cd quar`

$ `chmod +x quar.sh`

-----------
how to use:
-----------

$ `./quar.sh -S` to install AUR packages

$ `./quar.sh -R` to remove AUR packages

$ `./quar.sh -Rns` to purge AUR packages (wip feature)

$ have fun

*(note: you have to be in the same dir where quar installed, unless you put it in your `/usr/bin` directory!)*
