# quar
A shitty AUR helper with a very small amount of features that was created in 20 minutes for the soul purpose of doing something interesting with my life.

it's in the fucking description;
two shell scripts that can install and remove aur packages that were just made for fun, it IS plenty lighter than paru or yay, so do whatever you want.

be sure to make them executable!
